# Introduction #

As Layar develops and PorPOISe develops, more is possible with both. Here we collect feature requests that could make it into future versions. Think you would like to tick one off this list and gain same fame (sorry, no fortune)? Pipe up in the [Google group](http://groups.google.com/group/porpoise) and we'll help you get started. Have a wish you want to see added to this list? The same group is your place.

# The List #

|**Feature**|**Description**|**Intended release**|
|:----------|:--------------|:-------------------|
|CMS integration|The Dashboard is very spartan, but building and maintaining a flashy administration suite is a lot of work. Integrating PorPOISe as a plugin in content management systems like Joomla and Drupal would be the solution.|x.x                 |
|Automagic handling of `action=update`|Layar v4.1 supports partial updates. If default POIConnectors would support that it could save bandwidth and thereby load times.|?                   |
